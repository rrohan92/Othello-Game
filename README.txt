The assignment4 folder contains the following folders:

-AI
-AlphaBeta (extra credit)
-TimeAgent (extra credit)

AI folder contains implementation of Minimax agent. 
AlphaBeta folder contains implementation of Minimax with alphabeta agent.
TimeAgent folder contains implementation of Minimax with alphabeta agent with time constraint.

AlphaBeta pruning is much faster than normal minimax. Following is the comparison:

Time taken by minimax     Time taken by alphabeta           Depth

All 3 folders contain three different projects.

Note: Programming language used is Java and NetBeans IDE was used for this assignment.
      This program was tested on tux.

Instructions:
-Compile and run the Test.java file as it contains the main method.
-Source files are located in the following location:
  -assignment4 => AI => src => ai
-I have also included NetBeans build files, just in case.



For depth please enter values 1-7 because anything > 7 takes a long time.
For time please enter value greater than 100.
